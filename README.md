### What Are Networks
**Networks** are connections between scripts â€” similar to invisible **RemoteEvents** that allow scripts to communicate seamlessly.
These **Networks** help you transfer events, variables or any value from one script to another, keeping it nice and organised. Say **goodbye** to remote events!

### How To Set Up a Network
*(Assuming you have already imported LuaC.)*

1. **Create the network.**  
   To create a network, use the name you assigned to LuaC (in this example, `LuaC`) and call:  
   ```lua
   LuaC:CreateNetwork("NetworkName", script)
